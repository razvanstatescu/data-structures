# Data Structures in Javascript - Stack

**Stack** is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).
<br/><br/>
Check out [this YouTube video][videoUrl], where we implemented the Stack.
<br/><br/>
In [this][videoUrl] we implemented the following methods for the Stack class:
- push - Add element on top of the stack 
- pop - Return and remove the top element from the stack
- peek - Return top element from the stack
- isEmpty - Return true is the stack is empty or false otherwise
- size - Return the number of elements in the stack
- print - Prints out the stack in a nice, formatted way
- clear - Empty the stack

## Run the script

In order to run this you need to clone the repository and run `node stack.js` in this folder.
